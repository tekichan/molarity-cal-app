# Molarity Calculator (molarity-cal-app)

## Introduction

The **Molarity Calculator** is a web application designed for chemistry students and laboratory technicians. It provides a simple interface for calculating the molarity of solutions with ease.

### What is Molar Concentration?

Molar concentration is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. A solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L is said to be 1 molar, commonly designated as 1 M. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_concentration)

### Features

- Real-time molarity calculations as users adjust input values.
- Fully responsive design for an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## How to Use

This app is built with ReactJS. For installation and further details, please refer to the official [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

You can access the web app at: [https://tekichan.github.io/molarity-cal-app/](https://tekichan.github.io/molarity-cal-app/)

### Tunable Parameters

1. **Source Solution:**
   - **Molarity (M):** Adjusting this value will update the resulting molarity of the target solution.
   - **Volume (ml):** Changing this volume will affect the molarity of the target solution and the total volume of the target solution.

2. **Water:**
   - **Volume (ml):** Modifying this volume will influence the resulting molarity of the target solution and its total volume.

3. **Target Solution:**
   - **Molarity (M):** Changing this value will adjust the volume of water and the volume of the target solution accordingly.
   - **Volume (ml):** Adjusting this will update the volumes of the source solution and water.
